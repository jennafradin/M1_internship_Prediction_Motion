# MSc Internship


Internship under the supervision of [Robin Baures](http://cerco.ups-tlse.fr/) and [Tushar Chauhan](http://cerco.ups-tlse.fr/)

## Main objectif

We are living in a dynamic environment where moving object are often temporarily occluded and its sometimes necessary to estimate the exact position of this occluded object. This ability has been studied in laboratory with **motion extrapolation tasks** also known as **prediction motion tasks**.

During this internship, we worked on 3 differents prediction tasks: 

- In the first one, participants had to observe a ball that rotated clockwise. At an unpredictable point the ball disappeared. Participants assumed continued occluded rotation at the same velocity, and pressed when they heard a "bip" sound. At each trial, the velocity of the ball changed.

- The second one, participant had to observe the digital counter inside the moving ball. They had to only focus on the number not the motion. At an unpredictable point, the ball disappeared. Parcipants assumed contined to count at the same "speed", and pressed whe they heard a "bip" sound. At each trial, we varied the digital counter speed.

- In the last one, they had to do both tasks in the same time.
